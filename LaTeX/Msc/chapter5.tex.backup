\section{Overview and main results}
One main goal of this thesis was to apply DEIM to a POD-reduced model of Burgers' equation and compare the results of both reduced models with respect to accuracy and computational speedup. The theoretical derivations in Section \ref{Deim_chap} have shown that the POD-DEIM reduced Burgers' model is completely independent of the size of the full-order model $N$ whereas in the case of a purely POD-reduced model, the nonlinear term of Burgers' equation still depends on $N$. The numerical tests in Section \ref{sect2_numTests} have shown that the larger the original dimension $N$ is, the more speedup we obtain from DEIM. For $N=800$ and a viscosity parameter of $\nu = 0.0001$ we have shown that the speedup of POD-DEIM is about $52$ times the full-order model while a POD-reduced model only leads to a speedup of $16$. Further numerical tests have proven the independence of the POD-DEIM model of $N$.

In Section \ref{Opt_chap} and \ref{chap4}, the DEIM method has been used for the optimal control of Burgers' equation. In this thesis, we have compared the optimal control of Burgers' equation using the three different optimization algorithms BFGS, SPG and a Newton-type method. All of them have been applied to the optimal control of the full-order model as well as a POD and a POD-DEIM reduced model. Numerical tests have been shown that the optimal state of the reduced models is close to the optimal state of the full-order model. At the same time we have seen for $\nu = 0.0001$ and $N = 800$ that a computational speedup of more than $100$ times for the POD-DEIM reduced optimal control is possible whereas the POD-reduced model only let to a speedup of $\sim 80$. Additionally, the SPG method has been used to introduce so-called bound constraints on the control of the full-order and the respective reduced models. Numerical tests have shown that also for that case, the optimization of the POD-DEIM reduced model leads to a segnificant speedup and an optimal state that is close to the optimal state of the full-order model.

\section{Further research questions}
In Section \ref{smallu_sec}, we have derived a POD-DEIM reduced optimal control problem that uses only a low-dimensional control in order to drive the solution of Burgers' equation into the desired state. This has been done by defining discrete control points at which the control is allowed to be different from zero. Numerical tests in Section \ref{numTests} have shown that this approach leads to a tremendous reduction in computational time even for the optimization of the full-order Burgers' model. It has been shown as well that the choice of the position of the control points is crucial and requires some physical inside of the condsidered optimization problem. Since it is in general not clear which positions are optimal for the control points, it would be desirable to develop an algorithmic approach that reduces the dimension of the control and, thus, the dimension of the optimization problem and at the same time leads to an optimal state close to the desired state. During this thesis work, a POD-type approach in the sense that an SVD of a snapshot matrix of the control is computed and the optimization problem is formulated in terms of the coefficient vector of the leading singular vectors has been considered. This approach, however, did not lead to satisfying numerical results.

In order to further improve the computational gain of DEIM, the work of \cite{CS10,SN13} have shown that a model defined for the physical domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, for $d = {2,3}$, shows in general more potential for model order reduction. In \cite{CS10}, the authors present a speedup in CPU time of the numerical simulation of a 2D model of
