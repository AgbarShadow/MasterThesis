This Master thesis has been written within the Erasmus Mundus Master's program \textit{Computer Simulations for Science and Engineering (COSSE)}\footnote{For more information, please visit: \url{http://www.kth.se/en/studies/programmes/em/cosse}}. During the past two years of my studies, I had the opportunity to study for one year at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, as well as the Technical University in Delft, the Netherlands. But COSSE offers much more than the possibility to study at two world-known universities in the field of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics and, therefore, I am mostly thankful for the friendship and scientific influence of all the great people I met from all over the world.

Since the beginnings of my studies at TU Berlin more than five years ago, I was also supported by a scholarship of the \textit{Friedrich-Ebert foundation (FES)}\footnote{Again, more information are available online: \url{http://www.fes.de/studienfoerderung}}. The FES 

I would like to thank professor Volker Mehrmann and professor G\"unter B\"arwolff from TU Berlin who supported my application for COSSE. It is only because of them that I felt encouraged to apply for an international study programme and the Erasmus Mundus scholarship. Professor Mehrmann also gave crucial scientific advices to my thesis work whenever I was in Berlin.

Furthermore, I would like to thank the supervisors of my Master thesis, Martin van Gijzen and Marielba Rojas. Our weekly meetings, widely known as the  \textit{3M meetings}, always were inspiring, encouraging and, on a personal level, delightful. Both of you motivated me to continue my scientific career with a PhD.


During the last two years of studying abroad, the support of my parents never ended and I am very thankful for many of their advices during our \textsc{Skype} talks. Last but not least, I would like to thank Jana. Only because of you, I never felt lonely away from home.
