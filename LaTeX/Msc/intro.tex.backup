\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Motivation}
The efficient numerical solution of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDE) plays an important role in various fields of application such as fluid dynamics \cite{CM79,W01}, electromagnetics \cite{P98,T05} or heat transfer \cite{J03}. Often, those differential equations consist of nonlinear terms which are challenging to solve numerically. Furthermore, in engineering applications, one is often interested in an optimal solution of the considered PDE with respect to a certain objective function. This leads to the mathematical field of PDE-constrained optimization where a cost function is minimized and the PDE is considered as a constraint. As an example, one might imagine the flow of a fluid in a certain domain which is described by the nonlinear Navier-Stokes equations. The objective in that context might be to optimize the shape of the domain such that a desired flow behavior is obtained. This approach is, for example, been used in modern airplane design, cf. \cite{BC03,HM03,MP01} and the introductory examples therein.

Since the numerical treatment of modern engineering problems requires a huge computational effort, one is interested in mathematical models that reduce the dimension of the optimization problem tremendously and, at the same time, lead to a good approximation to the optimal solution of the original full-size problem. This leads to the field of Model Order Reduction (MOR) which is a relatively new field of mathematics, especially when the considered dynamical systems are nonlinear.
\section{Previous work}
Algorithms for model order reduction are best known in the context of linear control theory. Prominent textbooks on the field of control theory are for instance \cite{M04,Polderman1998,TSH01}. Therein, so-called \textit{input-state-output systems} of the form are considered,
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\label{ABCD}
\dot{x} &= A x + B u, \\
y &= C x + D u ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $u$ is considered as input, $x$ is the state of the system and $y$ is the output of the system. The matrices $A,B,C,D$ are assumed to have the appropriate dimensions. Note that \eqref{ABCD} can be considered as a dynamical system for the special case $C$ equals the identity matrix and $D = 0$. Then \eqref{ABCD} simplifies to $\dot{y} = A y + B u$, and we consider $u$ as the control and $y(u)$ as the solution of the dynamical system. Dynamical systems of this form arise for instance after spatial discretization of (linear) partial differential equation with a control.

The aim of model order reduction is to derive a system of the form \eqref{ABCD} with a similar input-output relation but a state variable $x$ of much smaller dimension. In the case of a linear system, there exist a wide range of algorithms that obtain a reduced system and that even guarantee a priori error estimates. The most important methods of linear MOR are,
\begin{itemize}
  \item balanced truncation,
  \item moment matching,
  \item Hankel-norm approximation,
  \item Krylov methods.
\end{itemize}
All of the above methods are discussed in detail in textbooks on linear MOR \cite{A05,SVR08} or presented in lectures notes of courses on that subject \cite{R12}. A brief presentation can also be found in the corresponding literature study to that thesis \cite{B13}.

Nonlinear dynamical systems with control are of the form,
\begin{align}
\label{nonlinDyn}
\dot{y} = f(y) + Bu,
\end{align}
with $f$ being nonlinear. There exist relatively new numerical methods for model order reduction of \eqref{nonlinDyn} which are of current scientific interest. Among them the method which is widely used in practice is the so-called proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) which is explained in detail in \cite{A00_diss,V11}. Since POD does not lead to a reduction of the involved nonlinearity, the  discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) has been developed recently \cite{Cha11,DEIM} in order to obtain a reduced system that does not depend at all on the dimension of the full-order model. DEIM has already been applied to complex dynamical processes, cf. \cite{CS10}, and has shown to lead to a huge gain in computational complexity. Further methods for MOR of nonlinear system are a generalization of balanced truncation to nonlinear systems \cite{L02} as well as a generalization of moment matching \cite{BS,CW}.

Since we want to apply model order reduction within the framework of optimal control of (nonlinear) partial differential equations, we also want to refer to standard literature from the field of optimal control and PDE-constrained optimization. A theoretical approach to that field is for instance given by \cite{L12,T10} where questions like existence and uniqueness of an optimal solution are considered. A more practical introduction to PDE-constrained optimization is given by the textbooks \cite {L71,H10} and the technical report \cite{H08}. An introduction to classical optimization methods is for instance given by \cite{Rao09}.
\section{Goals to achieve}
The aim of this Master thesis is the evaluation of model order reduction techniques when applied within the framework of optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations. In more detail, we are interested in the approximation error of the optimal solution and the computational benefit when different optimization algorithms are applied to a reduced model obtained via a POD-DEIM dimension reduction. In \cite{V08}, the author presents a general approach of the application of POD for PDE-constrained optimization. As a standard test case, we consider the optimal control of Burgers' equation as it has been done in \cite{H08,RK03}. In \cite{KV99}, the authors applied optimal control algorithms to POD-reduced model of Burgers' equation with good results regarding complexity reduction and quality of the approximation. The main contribution of this work is, however, to extend the approaches of \cite{KV99} and also apply DEIM to the reduced Burgers' model. Especially for a small viscosity parameter $\nu$, the full-size Burgers' model requires to be of large dimension. We present that the POD-DEIM reduced model is completely independent of that full-size dimension and, therefore, the computational speedup is almost independent of $\nu$.
\section{Chapter outline}
The thesis work is structured as follows: In \textbf{chapter 2} we present model order reduction methods for nonlinear dynamical system. This includes the method of proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and its improvement, the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). In \textbf{chapter 3}, we present methods for optimal control of PDE-constrained optimization problems. We will focus on two algorithms, one that takes only information of the first derivative of the objective function into account and another approach that also considers information of the Hessian of the objective function. Both chapters end with an application of the presented algorithms to the one-dimensional unsteady Burgers' equation. \textbf{Chapter 4} deals with a detailed discussion of optimal control when applied to the corresponding POD-DEIM-reduced model. We present an efficient way at which point during the optimization iteration it is sufficient to solve the reduced model instead of the full-dimensional problem. Also a detailed consideration of the approximation error on the one hand and the computational gain on the other hand is presented for both, a purely POD-reduced model and the model obtained by POD-DEIM. In \mbox{\textbf{chapter 5}} we given an outlook on further research questions that have not been considered in this thesis.
